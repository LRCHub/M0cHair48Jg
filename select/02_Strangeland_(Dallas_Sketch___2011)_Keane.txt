Lover, I remember laying out our map
Throwing our possessions in the van
Your tapes piled on the back seat
And a camera in your hand
Dressed for our arrival in the strangeland

Strangeland blind
You got no reason, you got no rhyme
You get no time to put things right, to put things right

We scream like fearless children
As we raced across wet sand
And leapt into the waters of the strangeland

And now the things I've done to forget you
Well, it's not what I had planned
Than there's still one more for me
When I've given you all I have

Strangeland blind
You got no reason, you got no rhyme
You get no time to put things right, to put things
Strangeland dreams
You got no mercy for fool like me
We get no time to put things right, to put things right

You wound the rope around me
Tight the knots with your own hand
The sweetest thoughts get twisted in the strangeland
